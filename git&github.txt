git branching: git divides repository into multiple branches so that different phases of developement will be covered.
  create a branch : git branch branchname
  goto a branch : git checkout branchname
  Then try to push code in that branch
  it creates a new branch with some changes, so you can create a pull request
  it compares for changes and merge that pull request code to main/master

Github repository can be copied in two ways.
   
   git clone : gti clone "link"

   git fork: git clone will not have any connection to the repository, Instead git fork will have connection such that future updates also will be notified
