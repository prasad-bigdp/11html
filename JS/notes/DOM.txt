HTML code (presentation code) is stored inside document object by Browser,
Using this object, we can take the values ,elements or any data from HTML to javascript
  To understand DOM(document Object Manipulation), we need to understand these three stages
  i. selection
  ii. Manipulation
  iii. creation

  i. selection :  document object provides some basic functions to select
  elements from HTML
      a. getElementsByTagName('tagname') : it selects all elements using that tagname and returns an array of elements.
      b. getElementsByClassName('className') : it selects all elements using class name and returns an array of elements.
      c. getElementById('idname') : it selects all elements using id and returns that element 
      d. querySelector: it selects first element that matches the query(css selectors)
      e. querySelectorAll : it selects all elements that matches the query and returns an array

    ii. Manipulation: we can Manipulate elements which are selected usinf its properties
      i. textContent : it contains all the text inside the element
      ii. style : using style attribute , you can add any styles to the selected element.
      iii. classList : using classList attribute , you can add one or more classes , you can remove the classes, even toggle the classes
      iv. innerHTML : using innerHTML, you can alter html code but it also have security issues like cross site scripting
      v. value: value is used to accept html input values .
