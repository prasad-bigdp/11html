AJAX(Asynchronous Javascript): it is a web development technique for creating dynamic and interactive web pages.
   --> AJAX loads separately
   --> AJAX uses Javascript to send request and handle the responses from server
   --> Asynchronous functions basically takes some time and always return promises
   Eg: timers(setTimeout,setInterval) , fetch etc..,
