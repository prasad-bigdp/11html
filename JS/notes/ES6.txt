ES6 (Ecma script):Ecmascript is a scripting language standard used for the cliend side scripting on the web . This is the foundation of Javascript. it releases version updates for all scripting languages. we have serveral versions and the latest one is ES15 released in 2024.
ES6 released in 2015 also known as ES2015 brought features like
   --> Template literals
   --> let and const keywords
   --> function optional parameters
   function sum(a,b=6){
    console.log(a+b)
   }
   sum(5)
   --> arrow function
   --> rest and spread operators
   --> destructuring of objects and arrays
   --> ES6 Module System
   --> OOP concepts

ES6 Module System: Module Systems are used to connect communication between multiple js files

 There are different module systems before ES6 like commonJS, requireJS, UMD etc.., But ES6 made it easy using keywords export and import
 Named Export:  use the export keyword to export variables or function, you can combine all and send as an objects
 Default Export: use export and default keywords to export a single value or function
 export const a=24; //named export
 export {fun,b} // named export
 export default a; //default export

 Named import: use curly braces {} to import exported values
  import {fun,a} from 'filepath'
 import alias : we can event import all values exported except default as an object using * 
  import * as obj from 'filepath'
 default import : we can import the default exported value without braces and can even change the name. it identifies correctly because one file will have only one default export
  import a from path

OOP :  
JS is a functional oriented programming but ES6 introduces class keyword to use object approach into JS

object is a physical entity . object exists with properties and methods
class is a structure for objects. it is a collection/factory of object
Fruit  - class  - name, color, shape,taste , eat()
fruit object --> apple -->

each object contains individual dynamic memory of class data
